Write a CRUD REST API using Python for a single resource type. You may use a framework (we use Tornado, but that is not required for this assessment).

The application must satisfy these requirements:

- Written in Python 3.8 or later.
- Endpoints to create, read, list, update, and delete objects called "Widgets"
- Widget objects include the following properties (at least):
    - Name (utf8 string, limited to 64 chars)
    - Number of parts (integer)
    - Created date (date, automatically set)
    - Updated date (date, automatically set)
    - Widgets are persisted to and retrieved from a SQLite file database.

- Include a README that describes how to setup and run the application.

Ideas to make the project even better:

- Include unit or functional test coverage
- Include an OpenAPI spec
- PEP8 compliance
- Pass standard lint tests (ie: flake8 or similar)
- Pass bandit security analysis
- Use Python type annotations
